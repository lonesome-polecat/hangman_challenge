# hangman_challenge
The game Hangman - designed and built for a BYU OIT coding challenge

This game is designed to run in the terminal or python console
All documentation is recorded in the flowchart or as comments and docstrings in the program code

Note: The complete project took me 3 hours and 15 minutes (about 2 hours coding and 1+ hour documenting)

As for my thought processes, I like making checklists for myself for what I need to do, but I was already provided with a checklist
so I just followed that. I will also often write pseudo-code or short snippets for particular functions of the program,
but the whole idea was simple enough I was able to more or less conceptualize it in my head and directly write the code.
I did add a losing aspect to the game, where if the user guesses incorrectly 7 times, the hanging man is completed and the player loses.
I also added an ending for the game if the user played it repeatedly until they guessed all the words. 
It was probably unnecessary but it is possible someone would and it would through an error, which is never good, so I fixed that. 
Those were the only ambiguities I found in the initial instructions.
